# Code runner

[Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)

One of the great features is:

Select text even in markdown text, and press `Ctrl + Alt + J`, code runner will run that code.

Or, for a separate js file, right click and click "Run Code" or press `Ctrl + Alt + N` with the file highlighted.
