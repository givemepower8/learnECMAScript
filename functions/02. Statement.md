[loop statements](https://www.inf.unibz.it/~calvanese/teaching/04-05-ip/lecture-notes/uni06/index.html)

in the statements, we have for loop, while loop, iterators. for loop is used with index, while loop is useful with boolean expression, stack, queue.

### while loop

<https://devdocs.io/javascript/statements/while>

### do...while loop

<https://devdocs.io/javascript/statements/do...while>

While loop:

- Entry-controlled loop (Checks whether the condition specified is true before executing the statements in the body of the loop).
- Doesn't execute even once if the condition is false.
- It is generally more useful and more commonly used.
- No semicolon at the end of the loop syntax.

Do-while loop:

- Exit-controlled loop (Checks the condition after executing the body of the loop).
- Executes at least once, even if the condition is false.
- Generally less useful and much less commonly used, as compared to while loop.
- Semicolon is required at the end of the loop syntax.

There are not many uses of the do-while loop.

### continue and break

The continue statement terminates execution of the statements in the current iteration of the current or labeled loop, and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration.

`continue` is often used with for loop.

```js
var text = "";

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    continue;
  }
  text = text + i;
}

console.log(text);
// expected output: "012456789"
```

The break statement terminates the current loop, switch, or label statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement.

```js
var i = 0;

var text = "";

while (i < 10) {
  i = i + 1;
  if (i === 3) {
    break;
  }
  
  text = text + i;
}

console.log(i);
console.log(text);
// expected output: 3
```

In contrast to the break statement, continue does not terminate the execution of the loop entirely: instead,

- In a while loop, it jumps back to the condition.
- In a for loop, it jumps to the update expression.

```js
var i = 0;
var n = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  i++;

  if (i === 3) {
    continue;
  }

  console.log(i);
  n += i;
}
```
