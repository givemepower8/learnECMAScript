# Primitives

These six types are considered to be primitives. A primitive is not an object and has no methods of its own. All primitives are immutable.

- Boolean — true or false
- Number — integers, floats, etc
- String — an array of characters i.e words
- Symbol — a unique value that's not equal to any other value
- Null — no value
- Undefined — a declared variable but hasn’t been given a value

Everything else is an Object type.

- Object
- Array
- Function
- Boolean
- Symbol
- Error
- Number
- String
- RegExp
- Math
- Set

## typeof

`typeof` always returns a string, and doesn't generate an error if the variable doesn't exist at all.

typeof() returns a string based on the data type of its operand.

Calling typeof on a variable or value returns one of the following values:

- "undefined" if the variable is of the Undefined type.
- "boolean" if the variable is of the Boolean type.
- "number" if the variable is of the Number type.
- "string" if the variable is of the String type.
- "object" if the variable is of a reference type or of the Null type.

Please notice that they are in lower case.

```js
console.log(typeof true);
console.log(typeof false);

console.log(typeof null); //object
console.log(typeof undefined); //undefined
```

typeof is safer to check undefined, use typeof(oneObject) === "undefined" can be used to check if the object exists (declared).

```js
if (typeof obj !== 'undefined') {
  // obj is a valid variable, do something here.
}
```
